##Goal of the Project
This is Udacity’s Capstone Project, using spark to analyze user behavior data from music app Sparkify. Through this project, I will examine and forecast the users of the online music streaming service called “Sparkify.” Millions of people play their favorite songs through music streaming services on a regular basis, either through a free-tier package that plays commercials, or through a paid subscription program that provides extra features and is usually ad-free. Users can upgrade or uninstall their subscription plan at any time, but they can also cancel it entirely, so it’s really important to make sure they enjoy the service.

## Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
1. pyspark.sql
2. seaborn
3. matplotlib.pyplot
4. datetime

## Descriptions
sparkify.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code that loads the dataset, cleans the data, and performs an exploratory analysis. The notebook also includes a function extraction method and training of various classification algorithm models.
